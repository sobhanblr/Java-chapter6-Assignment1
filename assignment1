//Defining an interface and its implementation in two different classes in different way.
Define an interface  having one method that takes an integer parameter. For this method, provide two 
implementations:  In the first one, just print the value and in the second one, print the square of the 
number.Try to call both the versions


interface MyInterface
{
   public void method1();
   public void method2();
}
  class XYZ implements MyInterface
  {
      public void method1()
      {
      System.out.println("implementation of method1");
      }
         public void method2()
         {
         System.out.println("implementation of method2");
         }
            public static void main(String arg[])
            {
            MyInterface obj = new XYZ();
            obj. method1();
            }
}
